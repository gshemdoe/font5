                </div>

                <div class="bodytxt">
                    With an increase in awareness and popularity of cryptocurrencies, its applications have continued to
                    develop, and many daily activities now involve the use of cryptocurrency due to its favorable
                    technological attributes, in comparison to previously used commodity services, according to (Nagpal,
                    2017). The most popular use of cryptocurrency is revolved around financial and payment services
                    (ibid). Such services include investing into digital assets, cryptocurrency trading, purchasing
                    goods and services, and sending or receiving money (ibid).
                    <br><br>
                    Firstly, cryptocurrency makes it possible for users around the world to invest in any digital asset,
                    and potentially gain a return on their investment, which is the overall goal of any investor (Chuen
                    et al., 2017). Users begin to see a change in their invested value once the price of the bought
                    cryptocurrency changes, for example, if the price of a cryptocurrency is higher than the price the
                    user has initially purchased for, the user is making a profit on their investment, and vice-versa.
                    The worth of a cryptocurrency is determined solely by the market and derived by its supply and
                    demand, and functions similarly to commodities on the stock market (Nagpal, 2017). As described in
                    Mikhaylov‚Äôs (2020) paper ‚ÄúCryptocurrency Market Analysis from the Open Innovation Perspective‚Äù, the
                    volatility of the cryptocurrency market is caused by investor sentiment, which states that the
                    market-wide sentiment has a stronger impact on cryptocurrencies, as once a user sees a rise in the
                    price of a cryptocurrency, they have a positive investor sentiment, leading to an increase in demand
                    for that token. Cryptocurrency can be an attractive investment due to its volatility in price,
                    making it riskier, which is not so apparent with other investment opportunities, such as stock
                    investment, foreign exchange investment, etc. that have less volatility and lower risk (Chuen et
                    al., 2017). Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have a finite amount that will ever be generated, which is
                    21 million (out of which 18.7 million have already been mined), meaning Bitcoin is scarce, which
                    gives it ‚Äúintrinsic‚Äù value, which could be an influential factor in its price (Brekke & Fischer,
                    2021). Furthermore, there are many ways to adopt cryptocurrencies. Some of the most popular ways
                    include through cryptocurrency exchange systems (Binance, Coinbase, Kucoin, etc.), through certain
                    banks that offer cryptocurrency purchasing and investment such as Revolut, Cashaa, etc. and even
                    through vending machines (ibid). The accessibility of adopting cryptocurrencies also makes the
                    investment more attractive, which is partially due to its decentralized attributes, making anyone
                    with an internet access applicable to own cryptocurrencies (ibid). The partial explanation for the
                    growth of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization is because the general public and firms
                    have realized the potential returns of investing into cryptocurrencies and wanted to join the
                    bandwagon, and by adopting cryptocurrencies, the market capitalization increased. For example,
                    according to Coinmarketcap, since Bitcoin surpassed its previous all-time-high market capitalization
                    of 2018 ($279 billion) in November 2020, its price went up by 253% as of time of writing and seeing
                    these potential investment gains are very attractive to the public (Cryptocurrency Prices, Charts
                    And Market Capitalizations, n.d.-b). A study by Glaser et al. (2014) has revealed that when a user
                    purchases Bitcoin, the main reason is for a speculative investment (Baur et al., 2017). This is why
                    the demand for cryptocurrency investment increased, causing an increase in cryptocurrency prices and
                    total market capitalization.
                    <br><br>
                    Secondly, following the purchasing of cryptocurrencies, they can be used to trade with on different
                    cryptocurrency exchange markets, with the intent of making a profit on the investment (Muftic et
                    al., 2017). Once a cryptocurrency is purchased, the user decides on their own strategy and decision
                    of how they will use their cryptocurrency to make a profit (ibid). There exist three types of
                    trading strategies, namely technical, fundamental, and recently, quantitative (Fang et al., 2021). A
                    technical trading strategy involves an analysis of the historical patterns of transaction data,
                    which is used by traders to determine the current and future market conditions, in order to make a
                    return on the investment (ibid). A fundamental trading strategy involves an analysis of the events
                    of the cryptocurrency company to determine when the cryptocurrency should be bought and sold for
                    profit (ibid). A quantitative strategy is similar to a technical one but uses a technical software
                    to conduct the trades for the user, by looking at the prices, volume, technical indicators, etc.
                    (ibid). If the user
                    <br><br>
                    decides to take out their investment and put it into a different cryptocurrency, it can be done
                    through pairs such as BTC/ETH, XRP/BTC, etc. where the user pays lower transaction fees than first
                    changing their cryptocurrency to a fiat cryptocurrency (BTC/USDT for example), and then purchasing
                    their desired cryptocurrency (ETH/USDT for example). There are lots of advantages to cryptocurrency
                    trading. Firstly, the cryptocurrency trading market is a 24-hour market, allowing users to trade at
                    any time they want (ibid). This is unlike the stock market where trading is possible only on
                    weekdays from 9:30AM ‚Äì 4PM, which is because stocks are centralized, meanwhile cryptocurrencies are
                    decentralized. Secondly, trading cryptocurrencies is pseudonymous, and does not make the traders
                    identity public, which provides an advantage regarding user privacy (ibid). Thirdly, because
                    cryptocurrencies are based on peer-to-peer transactions, they do not rely on financial institution
                    intermediaries, resulting in fewer transaction fees for the trader (ibid).
                    <br><br>
                    Thirdly, cryptocurrencies are widely used to purchase goods and services not only online, but also
                    in brick-and-mortar facilities. As of right now, cryptocurrency can be used as an alternative
                    monetary equivalent to money that is issued by a central authority, however, is decentralized and
                    more secure (Sukarno & Pujiyono, 2020). Companies accepting cryptocurrency payments are increasing,
                    some of the current notable ones being Barnes & Noble, Baskin Robbins, GameStop, Amazon‚Äôs Whole Food
                    Market, etc. (ibid). The process of paying for goods and services is done through initiating an
                    order for the good or service, deciding on the cryptocurrency token needed for the transaction,
                    transferring the required amount of cryptocurrency onto the account of the seller, and once the
                    payment is received, the customer can receive their good or service (Semenchuk & Andreev, 2019).
                    Another option of paying with cryptocurrency is through Crypterium‚Äôs global ‚ÄúCrypto Debit Card‚Äù,
                    where the user can top up a virtual or plastic card with cryptocurrencies, which are then converted
                    into fiat money and can be used for purchasing goods and services offline and online and withdrawing
                    funds from an ATM (Crypterium, n.d.). In 2018, Crypterium created a customer survey to better
                    understand how to increase customer adoption of cryptocurrencies, and out of the 400,000
                    participants, 70% of them stated that cryptocurrency cards are needed for mass adoption and issuing
                    them was a great leap towards the overall awareness, adoption, and use of cryptocurrencies in
                    day-to-day activities (ibid). Once awareness about attributes of cryptocurrencies such as
                    decentralization, security, privacy, and time saving increase, this will lead to an increase in the
                    use and adoption of cryptocurrency paying methods, on a public and corporate scale.
                    <br><br>
                    Lastly, cryptocurrency is used as an instrument for transferring and receiving money from anyone in
                    the world in a much faster and cheaper matter. The finances that a cryptocurrency user holds can be
                    found in the cryptocurrency wallet of the user, and when transferring funds to another user, it is
                    sent to their wallet. A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital wallet, essentially a computer program,
                    that provides the user access to data on the blockchain, which can then be seen by the user, as well
                    as have the user add new information onto the blockchain (Semenchuk & Andreev, 2019). In other
                    words, cryptocurrency wallets have access to the users public and private keys, allowing users to
                    keep track of their cryptocurrencies, and to receive and send cryptocurrencies (ibid). By using
                    cryptocurrencies for sending and receiving money, individuals that are unknown to each other can
                    safely perform transactions without a third-party intermediary, and do not need to trust one another
                    (Muftic et al., 2017). A practical benefit of being able to send any digital asset to another user
                    is that a guarantee exists for the safety of the transfer of funds, and this cannot be challenged,
                    due to the use of the blockchain public ledger in cryptocurrency transactions (ibid). Another
                    benefit of transacting with cryptocurrency are the low transaction fees in comparison to other
                    financial service companies such as Western Union. For instance, by using the TRC-20 (a technical
                    standard that is used for smart contracts on the Tron Blockchain) to send USDT (Tether, a
                    stablecoin) to another cryptocurrency wallet, the user sending the digital assets pays a 1$
                    transaction fee for any amount they wish to send (TRON Developer Group, 2021). Another useful
                    benefit of transacting with cryptocurrency is the speed of the transactions (Titov et al., 2021).
                    For instance, sending Bitcoin from one cryptocurrency wallet to another takes between 1-60 minutes,
                    and 10-20 minutes on average (ibid).
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, the main abilities of cryptocurrencies can make them more attractive to the public, as they
                    are more secure, time efficient, and cheaper than traditional financial services, and I believe an
                    increase in the awareness of these factors will increase the adoption and the use of
                    cryptocurrencies in the future.
