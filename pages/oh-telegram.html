                <div class="bodytxt">
                    Bitcoin and most of the other cryptocurrencies out there use a network protocol called Blockchain.
                    Blockchain can be understood as a mechanism where a distributed network of computer nodes, on
                    regular intervals, cross-check a set of new transactions, this is according to (Swan, 2015). More
                    simply put blockchain consists of blocks of data which are linked together like a chain. The entire
                    thing forms the DLT (distributed ledger technology). For example, in Bitcoin each block is limited
                    to a data size of one megabyte however there are no limits on the volume transactions that can be
                    added to a block unless it reaches the one MB file size. This is according to (BitcoinWiki, 2016).
                    The Blockchain “represents all verified and valid transactions between users of the network”, this
                    is according to (Glaser, et al., 2014).
                    <br><br>
                    Every single Bitcoin has its own unique address with both the private and public keys. These keys
                    are very important, the public keys can only be retrieved from the private ones. A transaction is
                    only given a go sign when the private key corresponds with a public key. This allows the users to
                    use blockchain to prove ownership of a bitcoin without the need for a third party for verification.
                    The maximum volume of bitcoins that can exist is limited to 21 million, coded within its software
                    and the estimated year for the last bitcoin mined is 2140. Protecting that private key is very
                    important as it is unique, if it gets lost or stolen it cannot be recovered. It is estimated that
                    the value of lost Bitcoins is US$ 950 million, this is according to (Berke, 2017).
                    <br><br>
                    It is suitable to look at blockchain as a database of transactions that get built gradually by
                    participants who are running the same software, guided by the inbuilt rules of the software itself.
                    This process continues as so long the software is being run by the participants. Because of these
                    participants, who are placed all over the world the system can keep running even if one individual
                    person pulls out from the system. Meaning that an individual participant cannot cause disruption or
                    modifications to the block, as all participants have a copy of the up to date block and can verify
                    the data with the network at all times. The information inside the blockchain is available for the
                    public to see and is shared amongst other participants. As a result, duplicating transactions or
                    counterfeiting are next to impossible. This solidifies trust and security in the system. Blockchain
                    in itself is a revolutionary technology whose source code can be improved and modified to benefit
                    the application into consideration. This opens the possibility for blockchain to store all sorts of
                    data for example, legal contracts, shares and bonds, and ownership titles of assets, this is
                    according to (Lee 2015), it can also record voting outcomes, this is according to (Noizat 2015). All
                    such advancements have given rise to block chain 2.0 developments, which is simply the application
                    of the technology to record items which are not currency related, this is according to (Swan 2015).
                    Different coins can use different complex mechanisms and have different features, and some agree
                    that these features aren’t yet fully discovered, this is according to (Phillip, Chan, & Peiris,
                    2018).
                    <br><br>
                    Investors in cryptocurrencies can be categorized into two, the miners and traders. The miners are
                    those who pool together the resources to carry out mining (Wang & Liu, 2015), and the traders who
                    buy and sell cryptocurrencies through trading platforms like Bitfinex and Coinigy. When it comes to
                    digital security many cryptocurrencies including bitcoin are designed to use SHA 256 Hash algorithm.
                    It’s full forms is Secured Hash Algorithm 256-bit, which was designed by the NSA, this is a secure
                    algorithm can be used to authenticate the integrity of data. Cryptographic hash functions are
                    digitally run mathematical operations. When miners are mining for cryptocurrencies, they basically
                    enter a completion of whose block gets added to the chain next. They all have to guess the answer to
                    a mathematical question and guess because it can be solved logically. Because of this large
                    computing power is required to guess the right answer first. As more and more miners participate the
                    answer to the question gets harder to guess. This system of working is known as proof of work. The
                    rate at which these calculations to find the answer can be simply put as the hash rate. It is
                    possible for anyone to use this function to generate an output when given an input, but it is
                    impossible to find out from the hash generated, what the input data was. This makes it very secure
                    to be used in cryptocurrencies mining. An important thing to remember is the higher the hash rate
                    the more immune the cryptocurrency would be to alterations and fraud.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Hash Rate for Bitcoin</b><br>
                    Currently the hash rate for bitcoin stands at about 200 million Tera-hashes per second. This is an
                    incredibly large amount of computing power from across the globe to keep the network secure.
                    Although it has decreased from mid 2021 since the crash indicating that some miners have stopped
                    mining or the new ones that hopped on the train have dropped out.
                    <br><br>
                    This decentralization of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is built upon Satoshi’s idea of merging
                    proof of work (PoW) ideas with other techniques, the hash of a block is linked with that of the
                    previous one (Sovbetov, 2018). Thus, an attacker wanting to counterfeit or modify data within the
                    bitcoin mining network would have to match that hash rate or have a higher rate. If an attacker
                    otherwise tries to generate an invalid block, it will get refused by the other miners as the hash of
                    that invalid block will need to match the last one and that of the previous one and so on until the
                    very first block which was generated by Satoshi himself, this is according to (Sovbetov, 2018).
                    <br><br>
                    However, cryptocurrency mining under PoW protocol is tedious and expensive requiring application
                    specific Integrated circuits (ASIC), these machines are built for the very purpose cryptocurrency
                    mining. Instead, these days most upcoming cryptocurrencies use proof-of-stake (PoS) procedure which
                    is more eco-friendly requiring less computing power and thus less energy, it is also cheaper to
                    operate under than PoS.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Here are how the transactions in the bitcoin and some altcoins work:</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    1. A public address is given to each person who has a wallet.
                    <br><br>
                    2. People can control that public key with a private one similar to an ATM pin.
                    <br><br>
                    3. They then Identify themselves on the bitcoin network and request for transfer of the
                    cryptocurrency from their public address to someone else’s.
                    <br><br>
                    4. The miners can then verify this transaction and add it to the blockchain. The concerning parties
                    can then view the transaction as complete using their public address (Scott, 2016).
                    <br><br>
                    Decentralized cryptocurrencies have the potential to change the existing retail system drastically
                    and it is important to understand factors that influence their adoption. Acceptance of digital
                    currencies as a supplementary payment method could be a marketing tool that makes firms stand out
                    (Roussou and Stiakakis, 2016). The adoption of cryptocurrency as a payment option is rapidly
                    increasing, with firms such as Microsoft, eBay, Dell, and Paypal, now accepting Bitcoin payments
                    (Ussel, 2015). Cryptocurrency payments are anonymous, it does not overtly identify the payer, or the
                    payee involved in a transaction, transactions are also irreversible.
                    <br><br>
                    Today bitcoin faces many competitors with different attributes to gain competitive advantage.
                    Nevertheless, the importance of cryptocurrencies is increasing day by day. There have been various
                    cryptocurrencies unique in their own way, such as Freicoin, this was a way to purposely include an
                    inflation within the system in order to stop the trend of people hoarding on their currencies and
                    not suing them. Some have even built their own cryptocurrencies based on their preferences and
                    culture, Doge coin for example which was built out of fun from an internet meme which today sits at
                    $241 million in market capitalization. Regardless of their philosophies and culture. They have, in
                    the general sense have become related to liberal thought.
                    <br><br>
                    The understanding of the workings of cryptocurrencies is important for people to be confident enough
                    to use them. Although this paper only covers the workings of bitcoin and a few other altcoins as
                    covering all of them is out of the scope of this paper. As mentioned earlier there are more than
